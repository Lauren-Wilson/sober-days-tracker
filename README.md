# Sober Days Tracker

## Overview

**Sober Days Tracker** is a simple yet powerful Python script designed to help individuals track their sobriety journey. By entering your sobriety start date, this script calculates the exact number of days, months, and years you've been sober. This project was born out of a personal need to stay accountable and motivated on the path to recovery, and I hope it can serve as a helpful tool for others on similar journeys.

## Why This Script?

Sobriety is a daily commitment, and every day is a milestone worth celebrating. Tracking your progress can be a powerful reminder of how far you've come, providing encouragement during challenging times and reinforcing the positive changes you've made. While there are many apps and tools available, I wanted something lightweight, private, and customizable — a tool that anyone can easily run on their own system, free of distractions and external dependencies.
